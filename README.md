1. You need to install pytesseract using windows installer available at: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Note the folder where pytesseract is installed and add it into the system variable 'Path'
3. Running the program is done by:
   a) running the main.py file using python interpreter
